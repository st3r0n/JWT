jwt has three parts 
header+payload +signature   each separated by a dot
header and paylaod are base64 encoded

vulns 
server does ot ahave any info about token the token is self contained

+++++++++++++++ATTACKS++++++++++++++++
1.server doesnot veify the signature at all
if server does not verify the siganture we can just modify the paylaod without the nedd for siganture

2.accepting token with no siganture 
set value of signature to none 



3.brute forcing secret keys
1.get the JWT token and use hashcat to geta secret key --> hashcat m 16300 hash wordlsist
2.generate a new key from jwt editor in burp  --> llok at the encryption used and ganerate symmetrivc key encryption using either the secretkey or pregenerated keys 
the K value is the secret key in base64 encoded
modify and sign the key ---> use burp repeater to modify secret key and sign the key ---> make sure do not modu=ify header is selected




4.jwt header parameter injection
some important headers 


    jwk (JSON Web Key) - Provides an embedded JSON object representing the key.

    jku (JSON Web Key Set URL) - Provides a URL from which servers can fetch a set of keys containing the correct key.

    kid (Key ID) - Provides an ID that servers can use to identify the correct key in cases where there are multiple keys to choose from. Depending on the format of the key, this may have a matching kid parameter.
these can be useful when web tokens uses assymetric cryptography like rsa

i} use of jwk injection attack
I generate a new rsa key from jwt editor and choose the key size from lag param of token
II  send the request to burp repeater and change the paramaters you want to modify
II click attack and select embedded jwk method and athen select the rsa key ganerated




5.use of jku header injection  --- it requires a URL to be sued as jku fetches keys froma specific URL
I generate new rsa key from jwt editor and select copy public key as JWK
II in THEe web server that will serve the jwk paste the JWk key with format :
{
    "keys": [
        {
            "kty": "RSA",
            "e": "AQAB",
            "kid": "893d8f0b-061f-42c2-a4aa-5056e12b8ae7",
            "n": "yy1wpYmffgXBxhAUJzHHocCuJolwDqql75ZWuCQ_cb33K2vh9mk6GPM9gNN4Y_qTVX67WhsN3JvaFYw"
        }
    ]
}
II now in repeater modify value of kid withe the generated key and add a jku parameter to header with value as url we created
IV now sign the key and send it



6.using kid parameter
kis is used to identify we can use any file for kid parameter bu /dev/null is used as it is availbale in almost all linux dvices
I generate a symmetric key with suitable size now change the value of k to AA== wchich us equivalent to null 
II in the repeater tab modify the cookie and point the kid paramter to ../../../../../dev/null and sign the key
